On examination of the grievance filed and the attachments enclosed, it is submitted that the petitioner is filing vague petitions and is requesting to grant rewards for the petitions filed by him. In this regard, it is submitted that Reward is given based on the detection of undisclosed income on the basis of information provided by the petitioner. However, in the present case, the petitioner filed grievance seeking reward as per Income Tax Reward Scheme to help and support his unemployment and poverty referring to earlier petitions filed by him with various officers and investigation agencies which were already disposed. Since no new information was provided by the petitioner in grievance excepting requesting the interim reward as per Income Tax Reward Scheme, the question of reward does not arise and his grievance petition is disposed accordingly.\t",

It is an undeveloped hill cum inter remote area and has been cut out from other part of mainstream area of this country since long time. The network connectivity and internet penetration for Telecommunication is very poor and even not working properly. The residents of this village, students and other business personalities are unable to access the internet for their banking and other online services. The students are also unable to attend any online activities due to above mentioned problems. The people are unable to call the ambulance, fire services due to the lack of network problem during emergency time. The facilities of digital India has not reached to these area till now. They have been underprivileged and digitally not connected with rest of the country. \r\nTherefore, I kindly request you to please install a new Reliance Jio-4G\/5G cum BSNL-3G\/4G\/5G Mobile Tower under the scheme of Universal Service Obligation Fund (USOF) at the particular place of Nepal village which comes under the Banthapur Gramapanchyat of Odagaon Block in Nayagarh District of Odisha State.

Its a great matter of shame that this dth operator doesnt display channels accordance to the state or region. What do people of Telangana understand Tamil as startup channel and what do people of Karnataka understand channel of Tamil i.e Sun Tv . How do illerate people understand how to operate channels if they are not properly arranged in order of their dwelling states. Management should have minimum knowledge to correct and address these changes. Pathetic and poor customer care officers, even the appellate authority seems to be weird in addressing reagional channels on startup. Local cable operators and MSO are far better than a South operated dth operator like yours,who doesnt even understand customer needs. Secondly, issue of very less news channels in telugu whereas there are so many channels in tamil language. Its a language discrimination and barrier setup by your firm. You being operator from from Tamil Nadu doesnt mean that you favour only customers of Tamil Nadu and leave other people interest. Im gonna seriously write to TRAI and MSO forum on the same on the discrimination of channel preference as per states.",

Although Regional office Noida settled the transfer claim form 13 but the transferred amount could not be credited to the member id X-X-X-X-X, as investigation is going on against the establishment M\/s D K Construction bearing code Number X-X-X-X-X for doing some suspicious activities. It observed that recently many member of the establishment have taken transfer from other region and after working less than a month, they have approved for final settlement from member id of this establishment. This case is one of the many cases which comes under fraud committed by certain bogus\/fraudulent employer who has shown employees working in some other establishment as his own employee by linking their existing UAN and thereby attaining the right to modify the KYC of such employees. This type of fraud has been clarified as \u201cChandigarh\u201d type of fraud by the Head Office of EPFO. As the activity of the establishment is found to be suspicious at this stage, final decision in the matter will be taken after receipt of the investigation report from the Enforcement officer.

But he produces false\/fake documents at the time of appointment on compassionate grounds. It&#39;s a subject of investigation. \r\n       Kindly verify his documents and their both sisters documents so that you come to a conclusion.\r\n       At the time of birth of Md. Salim on 01\/04\/1985 his Father Name was Md. Husain after his Younger Sister\u2019s birth on 15\/09\/1990 her Father Name was Md. Ainul Haque and her Mother\u2019s name is same  Halima Khatun.\r\n     Where is his other father? Which he has not mentioned anywhere. It could also mean that he had killed her and thrown her away. It comes under suspicion. It is also under doubt that which of his father was work in the Railway.\r\n    If he got a job in the name of the first father then what did he do with the second father and if he got a job in the name of the second father then what did he do with the first father. It is often doubted.\r\n    How did he get a compassionate job? \r\n    In whose name is he doing the job?\r\n    It means he faked something.\r\n    Kindly take this matter serious, investigate this and take appropriate action against him.",
