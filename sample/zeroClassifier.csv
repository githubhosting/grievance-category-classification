       After meeting reg development of Beri Panchpota Ecotourism in west bengal with Honorable Secretary (Central Tourism Ministry) Mr. Arvind Singh, nearly Eight months passed. There was no initiative to build Ecotourism at Beri Panchpota in west bengal till now. 


       The Beri Panchpota village at Gaighata Block in westbengal is situated 70 km away from Kolkata city in India. Five horse nail shaped lakes (Natural oxbow Lake) flowing in this village. Two biggest lake in this village are Beri lake (8.23 Km long) and Duma lake (14 km long). Others lake are approximately 6 km, 4 km and 3.5 km long. All lakes are naturally developed, and stunningly beautiful sweet rainwater fed water body. All lakes boasts of natural habitats of traditional small fishes, birds, tortoise, flora and fauna. We want to build an eco-tourism in this area. The development of the Beri Panchpota Ecotourism center will benefit millions of people in at least three assembly constituencies in West Bengal. We want, this tourism project should be developed in collaboration with the central and state government both. 



         But, I am sorry to inform you that there was no initiative to build Ecotourism at Beri Panchpota in west bengal till now, even after meeting with Honorable Secretary (Tourism) Mr. Arvind Singh.

1.       The promotion and development of tourism including eco-tourism is primarily the responsibility of State Government/ UT Administrations.

2.       However, the Ministry of Tourism, under its various scheme guidelines provides financial assistance to State Governments/ Union Territory Administrations for development of tourism related infrastructure in the country.

3.       The projects undertaken for development by the Ministry are identified in consultation with State Governments/ Union Territory Administrations / Central Agencies and are sanctioned subject to submission of project proposals by them, their adherence to relevant scheme guidelines, submission of suitable Detailed Project Reports, availability of funds and utilization of funds released for projects sanctioned earlier.

4.       There is no provision of taking up the infrastructure development projects directly by the Ministry of Tourism under its schemes.
 
5.	With a view to act upon your several representations and meetings with senior officers, and under directions from the Ministry of Tourism, this office had undertaken a site visit to explore the possibilities of developing Beri Panchpota as an Eco-tourism spot. The relevant report dated 24.06.2022 was sent to the Niche Tourism Division of the Ministry of Tourism. The report, inter alia, stated that Beri Panchpota has the potential to become an Eco-tourism spot subject to creation and development of some civic amenities as well as tourism infrastructure and that many interventions in these areas may be required from the Government.

6.	The said report of this office was forwarded by the Ministry of Tourism to the Govt. of West Bengal, with a request to take further necessary action in this regard.

This is with reference to the issue i have faced for which i would like to lodge complaint against BSNL Kalyani Exchange wherein they have issued Duplicate SIM which is in my mother&#39;s name (Aruna Chakraborty) without my permission and knowledge hence I would like to register this complaint and would like necessary actions to be taken.

BSNL Kalyani Exchange which has carried out this transaction in issuance of the SIM Card on 17th Dec 2022 was confirmed with BSNL customer care on the said date for the following number: X4X7X2X3X2

I would also like to inform you that I will be taking legal actions for the same as because of this mistake in issuing the SIM without verifying the details has caused financial fraud in my savings account on 19th Dec 2022 amounting to Rs.13,74,000.

I also went to Kalyani BSNL exchange on 22nd Dec and they have shared the documents with which the Duplicate SIM was issued and on looking at those we could clearly see the documents were fake and were not verified by BSNL Officials.

I am also attaching the fake documents I have received from the exchange which was used to issue the SIM Card along with the Original Document.

To hide their fraud, the company Infoblox has not provided my EPF, Form-16 for the financial year 2021 to 2022 and deliberately withheld my Form-16, all Tax statements, payslips showing break-up, gross &amp; net salary. Infoblox is intentionally doing this to harass me. Even after submitting my grievance XOXEX/X/X0X2X0X9X6 in EPFO, still my EPF money was not transferred by Infoblox. Infoblox deliberately did not mark my Exit and also I got cheated by Infoblox for (X-X-X-X-X) for not matching Employee contribution to Employer contribution ratio. I am bringing this to your kind attention.


 I humbly pray and request you to initiate appropriate action as against Infoblox Technical Support and Software Development Private Limited to match Employee contribution to Employer contribution, mark my Exit and kindly request you to recover my EPF amount from Infoblox and transfer to my current EPF account with interest.

 

Your faithfully,

Honourable Minister Department of Telecommunications, Government of India.
(Grievance-Dear Sir, I would like to draw your urgent attention that Nepal village which comes under the Banthapur Gramapanchyat of Odagaon Block in Nayagarh District of Odisha State. It is an undeveloped hill cum inter remote area and has been cut out from other part of mainstream area of this country since long time. The network connectivity and internet penetration for Telecommunication is very poor and even not working properly. The residents of this village, students and other business personalities are unable to access the internet for their banking and other online services. The students are also unable to attend any online activities due to above mentioned problems. The people are unable to call the ambulance, fire services due to the lack of network problem during emergency time. The facilities of digital India has not reached to these area till now. They have been underprivileged and digitally not connected with rest of the country. 
Therefore, I kindly request you to please install a new Reliance Jio-4G/5G cum BSNL-3G/4G/5G Mobile Tower under the scheme of Universal Service Obligation Fund (USOF) at the particular place of Nepal village which comes under the Banthapur Gramapanchyat of Odagaon Block in Nayagarh District of Odisha State.

-----------------------
It is brought to the notice of SUN DIRECT that the first channel after the setup is turned on,turns out to be a Tamil Channel.  Its a great matter of shame that this dth operator doesnt display channels accordance to the state or region. What do people of Telangana understand Tamil as startup channel and what do people of Karnataka understand channel of Tamil i.e Sun Tv . How do illerate people understand how to operate channels if they are not properly arranged in order of their dwelling states. Management should have minimum knowledge to correct and address these changes. Pathetic and poor customer care officers, even the appellate authority seems to be weird in addressing reagional channels on startup. Local cable operators and MSO are far better than a South operated dth operator like yours,who doesnt even understand customer needs. Secondly, issue of very less news channels in telugu whereas there are so many channels in tamil language. Its a language discrimination and barrier setup by your firm. You being operator from from Tamil Nadu doesnt mean that you favour only customers of Tamil Nadu and leave other people interest. Im gonna seriously write to TRAI and MSO forum on the same on the discrimination of channel preference as per states."," Service provider has informed this Ministry that they have tried to reach customer, but customer is not in use.","('Telecommunications', 'Others')","('Ministry of Information and Broadcasting', 'DTH Matters', 'Any Other')"
