Its a great matter of shame that this dth operator doesnt display channels accordance to the state or region. What do people of Telangana understand Tamil as startup channel and what do people of Karnataka understand channel of Tamil i.e Sun Tv . How do illerate people understand how to operate channels if they are not properly arranged in order of their dwelling states. Management should have minimum knowledge to correct and address these changes. Pathetic and poor customer care officers, even the appellate authority seems to be weird in addressing reagional channels on startup. Local cable operators and MSO are far better than a South operated dth operator like yours,who doesnt even understand customer needs. Secondly, issue of very less news channels in telugu whereas there are so many channels in tamil language. Its a language discrimination and barrier setup by your firm. You being operator from from Tamil Nadu doesnt mean that you favour only customers of Tamil Nadu and leave other people interest. Im gonna seriously write to TRAI and MSO forum on the same on the discrimination of channel preference as per states.",

It observed that recently many member of the establishment have taken transfer from other region and after working less than a month, they have approved for final settlement from member id of this establishment. This case is one of the many cases which comes under fraud committed by certain bogus\/fraudulent employer who has shown employees working in some other establishment as his own employee by linking their existing UAN and thereby attaining the right to modify the KYC of such employees. This type of fraud has been clarified as \u201cChandigarh\u201d type of fraud by the Head Office of EPFO. As the activity of the establishment is found to be suspicious at this stage, final decision in the matter will be taken after receipt of the investigation report from the Enforcement officer. Hence, the complainant may be advised to wait for some time till the final outcome of the investigation\tSHASHI BHUSHAN KUMAR (RPFC I)\t",
